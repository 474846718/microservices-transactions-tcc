# Microservices and data consistency (I)

As you can read in [Christian Posta's excellent article](http://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/the-hardest-part-about-microservices-data/), when designing a microservices-based solution, to solve consistency between bounded contexts our first choice will be to communicate boundaries with immutable point in time events by means of a messaging queue/listener, a dedicated event store/publish-subscribe topic or a replicated log/event processor.

Let's describe that approach:
